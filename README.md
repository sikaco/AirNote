A note app just like air, concise but necessary.

## Develop

### Run
```
npm start
```

### EcmaScript 6 default

```
"presets": [
  ["es2015", {"modules": false}]
],
```

### Type
1. No `<any>` except of `types` folder.
1. Avoid `<any>` in `types` folder as much as possible.
1. Not add prefix `I` to interface declare which in `types`
